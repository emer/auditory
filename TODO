I think Power and MelFBank can be local. Just keep PowerSegment and MelFBankSegment part of struct.

Then rename dropping Segment portion

And do we really need Power and LogPower - just keep the latter

The implementation would be much cleaner if all the looping were replace with matrix operations

MFCC, DFT, DCT should be uppercase
